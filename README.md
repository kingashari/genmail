This script is very useful for testing purposes, mass account creation, or other situations that require a unique and secure email and password combination.

The usefulness of this program is to log into a website that requires email, but which does not use code verification.

1. Open via cmd by double-clicking on the file
2. use vscode or other python debugger
3. Telegram Bot (maybe someday this can be run with bots in telegram.
4. install library faker (pip install faker for windows)

This project will be continued until it reaches the perfect point, and will continue to be developed.
